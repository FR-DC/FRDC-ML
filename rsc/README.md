# FRDC Resources

We have 2 type of resources:

1) Raw: Uncompressed, raw data from our UAV drones
2) Debug: Compressed version of the raw data used for
   1) Unit Testing
   2) Integration Testing
   3) Experimentation Debugging

You shouldn't need to touch this, this will be used to cache large raw `tif` files.
