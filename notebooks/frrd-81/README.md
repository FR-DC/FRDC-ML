## FRRD-80/81: Visualization of FixMatch

This simply shows the embeddings of the FixMatch model.
The embeddings are generated by the model and then visualized using LDA.

We found that the model transfer doesn't necessarily equate to a well separated
embedding space. This is likely due to the fact that the model is trained on
too small of a dataset.

We attribute much of performance degradation to our contextual shift when
we chose our backbone model. We chose a model that was trained on ImageNet,
which in retrospect, has a large contextual shift from our dataset.

However, it's not all bad, we reinforced the idea that this shift is a real
problem and that we need to address it in our future work.
