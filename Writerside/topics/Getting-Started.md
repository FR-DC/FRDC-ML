<procedure title="Installing the Dev. Environment" id="install">
  <step>Ensure that you have the right version of Python.
    The required Python version can be seen in <code>pyproject.toml</code>
    <code-block lang="ini">
        [tool.poetry.dependencies]
        python = "..."
    </code-block>
  </step>
  <step>Start by cloning our repository.
    <code-block lang="shell">
      git clone https://github.com/FR-DC/FRDC-ML.git
    </code-block>
  </step>
  <step>Then, create a Python Virtual Env <code>pyvenv</code>
    <tabs>
    <tab title="Windows">
      <code-block lang="shell">python -m venv venv/</code-block>
    </tab>
    <tab title="Linux">
      <code-block lang="shell">python3 -m venv venv/</code-block>
    </tab>
    </tabs> 
  </step>
  <step>
    <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">Install Poetry</a>
    Then check if it's installed with
    <code-block lang="shell">poetry --version</code-block>
    <warning>
    If <code>poetry</code> is not found, it's likely not in the user PATH.
    </warning>
  </step>
  <step>Activate the virtual environment
    <tabs>
      <tab title="Windows">
        <code-block lang="shell">
          cd venv/Scripts
          activate
          cd ../..

      </tab>
      <tab title="Linux">
        <code-block lang="shell">
          source venv/bin/activate
        </code-block>
      </tab>
    </tabs> 
  </step>
  <step>Install the dependencies. You should be in the same directory as
    <code>pyproject.toml</code>
    <code-block lang="shell">
      poetry install --with dev
    </code-block>

  <step>Install Pre-Commit Hooks

      pre-commit install
    </code-block>
  </step>
</procedure>


<procedure title="Setting Up Google Cloud" id="gcloud">
  <step>
    We use Google Cloud to store our datasets. To set up Google Cloud,
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install">
      install the Google Cloud CLI
    </a>
  </step>
  <step>
    Then,
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing">
      authenticate your account
    </a>.
    <code-block lang="shell">gcloud auth login</code-block>
  </step>
  <step>
    Finally, 
    <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc">
      set up Application Default Credentials (ADC)
    </a>.
    <code-block lang="shell">gcloud auth application-default login</code-block>

  <step>
    To make sure everything is working, <a anchor="tests">run the tests</a>.
  </step>
</procedure>

<procedure title="Setting Up Label Studio" id="ls">
  <tip>This is only necessary if any task requires Label Studio annotations</tip>
  <step>
    We use Label Studio to annotate our datasets.
    We won't go through how to install Label Studio, for contributors, it
    should be up on <code>localhost:8080</code>.
  </step>
  <step>
    Then, retrieve your own API key from Label Studio.
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/user/account"> Go to your account page </a>
    and copy the API key. <br/></step>
  <step> Set your API key as an environment variable.
    <tabs>
      <tab title="Windows">
        In Windows, go to "Edit environment variables for
        your account" and add this as a new environment variable with name
        <code>LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY</code>.
      </tab>
      <tab title="Linux">
        Export it as an environment variable.
        <code-block lang="shell">export LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY=...</code-block>
      </tab>
      <tab title=".env">
        In all cases, you can create a <code>.env</code> file in the root of 
        the project and add the following line:
        <code>LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY=...</code>
      </tab>
    </tabs>
  </step>
</procedure>

<procedure title="Setting Up Weight and Biases" id="wandb">
  <step>
    We use W&B to track our experiments. To set up W&B,
    <a href="https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart">
      install the W&B CLI
    </a>
  </step>
  <step>
    Then, 
    <a href="https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart">
      authenticate your account
    </a>.
    <code-block lang="shell">wandb login</code-block>
  </step>
</procedure>

<procedure title="Pre-commit Hooks" collapsible="true">
  <note>This is optional but recommended.
  Pre-commit hooks are a way to ensure that your code is formatted correctly.
  This is done by running a series of checks before you commit your code.
  </note>
  <step>
    <code-block lang="shell">
      pre-commit install
    </code-block>
  </step>
</procedure>

<procedure title="Running the Tests" id="tests">
  <step>
    Run the tests to make sure everything is working
    <code-block lang="shell">
      pytest
    </code-block>
  </step>
</procedure>

## Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError

It's likely that your `src` and `tests` directories are not in `PYTHONPATH`.
To fix this, run the following command:

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./src:./tests
```

Or, set it in your IDE, for example, IntelliJ allows setting directories as
**Source Roots**.

### google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError

It's likely that you haven't authenticated your Google Cloud account.
See [Setting Up Google Cloud](#gcloud)

### Couldn't connect to Label Studio

Label Studio must be running locally, exposed on `localhost:8080`. Furthermore,
you need to specify the `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY` environment variable. See
[Setting Up Label Studio](#ls)

### Cannot login to W&B

You need to authenticate your W&B account.
See [Setting Up Weight and Biases](#wandb)
If you're facing difficulties, set the `WANDB_MODE` environment variable
to `offline`
to disable W&B.

## Our Repository Structure

Before starting development, take a look at our repository structure. This will
help you understand where to put your code.

```mermaid
graph LR
    FRDC -- " Core Dependencies " --> src/frdc/
    FRDC -- " Resources " --> rsc/
    FRDC -- " Tests " --> tests/
    FRDC -- " Repo Dependencies " --> pyproject.toml,poetry.lock
    src/frdc/ -- " Dataset Loaders " --> ./load/
    src/frdc/ -- " Preprocessing Fn. " --> ./preprocess/
    src/frdc/ -- " Train Deps " --> ./train/
    src/frdc/ -- " Model Architectures " --> ./models/
    rsc/ -- " Datasets ... " --> ./dataset_name/
```

src/frdc/
: Source Code for our package. These are the unit components of our pipeline.

rsc/
: Resources. These are usually cached datasets

tests/
: PyTest tests. These are unit, integration, and model tests.

### Unit, Integration, and Pipeline Tests

We have 3 types of tests:

- Unit Tests are usually small, single function tests.
- Integration Tests are larger tests that tests a mock pipeline.
- Model Tests are the true production pipeline tests that will generate a
  model.

### Where Should I contribute?

<deflist>
<def title="Changing a small component">
If you're changing a small component, such as a argument for preprocessing,
a new model architecture, or a new configuration for a dataset, take a look
at the <code>src/frdc/</code> directory.
</def>
<def title="Adding a test">
By adding a new component, you'll need to add a new test. Take a look at the
<code>tests/</code> directory.
</def>
<def title="Changing the model pipeline">
If you're a ML Researcher, you'll probably be changing the pipeline. Take a
look at the <code>tests/model_tests/</code> directory.
</def>
<def title="Adding a dependency">
If you're adding a new dependency, use <code>poetry add PACKAGE</code> and
commit the changes to <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>poetry.lock</code>.
<note>
    E.g. Adding <code>numpy</code> is the same as 
    <code>poetry add numpy</code>
